# 1D-Finite-Volume-Solver-for-Elliptic-PDEs
This repository contains a MATLAB implementation of a 1D finite difference (cell-centered finite volume) method for solving linear elliptic partial differential equations. It supports user-defined grids, boundary conditions, and exact solutions, making it versatile for numerical experimentation.
